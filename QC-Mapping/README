This folder contains all scripts to process the FASTQs until they're ready for SNV/CNV calling.
The pipeline goes as follows:

####
1. CutAdapt.sh
2. BWA.sh
3. Merge-Dedup.sh
4. BaseRecal.sh
5. IndelRealignment.sh

####
**CutAdapt**
- Remove adapter sequences from seq and wga libraries
- Remove low quality reads
**BWA**
- Align reads onto reference genome (hs37d5.fa)
- Sort and index resulting BAM.
**Merge & Dedup**
- Merge BAM files from same single-cell
- Mark duplicated reads
**BaseRecal**
- Perform base quality recalibration
**IndelRealignment**
- Perform realignment around indels. While this is no longer part of GATK's best practices (as HC now performs indel realignment internally), we're going to be using a different calling algorithm (SCcaller) which doesn't perform this step.
