This folder contains the scripts needed to run SCcaller for SNV identification.
Since SCcaller performs SNV calling for each cell individually, we have to run it twice:

**SCcaller_Run1.sh**
- Standard SCcaller run. We're doing the runs in a loop per chromosome instead processing the full genome at once (otherwise it takes too long).
**SCcaller_Run2.sh**
- Modified version by @TamaraPrieto which essentially performs calling for the set of sites identified in the previous version (similar to GATK's GenotypeGivenAlleles).
- This allows users to fetch all REF/REF positions for all cells to avoid having too much missing data after merging the calls from each cell.

Afterwards, follow the provided filtering script to apply all our filtering criteria:
- Remove CN-deletions
- Apply consensus filter
- Apply missingness filter
