This folder contains the scripts needed to run SCcaller for SNV identification.
Since SCcaller performs SNV calling for each cell individually, we have to run it twice:

**SCcaller_Run1.sh**
- Standard SCcaller run. We're doing the runs in a loop per chromosome instead processing the full genome at once (otherwise it takes too long).
**SCcaller_Run2.sh**
- Modified version by @TamaraPrieto and @LauraTomas which essentially performs calling for the set of sites identified in the previous step (similar to GATK's GenotypeGivenAlleles).
- This allows users to fetch all REF/REF positions to avoid having too much missing data after merging the callsets from each cell.

Afterwards, follow the provided filtering script to apply all our filtering criteria:
- Remove CN-deletions
- Apply consensus filter
- Apply missingness filter
