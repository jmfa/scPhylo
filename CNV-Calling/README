This folder contains the scripts needed for GINKGO CNV calling (using a local installation).
Essentially, one just needs to generate bed files from the processed BAM files using BAMtoBED.sh.
Afterwards, simply run GINKGO using the available analyze.sh script.

Do not forget to change the variables in analyze.sh, namely:
$dir
$home
